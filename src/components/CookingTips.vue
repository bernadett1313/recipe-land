As our cookery team has spent so many hours writing and triple-testing recipes, they’ve picked up a fair few tricks and tips along the way, so we asked them to impart their wisdom…</p>

                <h3 class="uppercase text-[1.17rem] md:text-xl xl:text-2xl font-medium">Solution: add vinegar</h3>

But did you know that adding a dash of vinegar to the water when boiling eggs helps the shell peel off more easily? Say goodbye to piles of tiny egg shell shards.</p>

                <h3 class="uppercase text-[1.17rem] md:text-xl xl:text-2xl font-medium">Solution: use a pizza cutter</h3>

                <h3 class="uppercase text-[1.17rem] md:text-xl xl:text-2xl font-medium">Solution: freeze them</h3>

To stop it happening again, make sure the storage space is nice and dry.</p>

                <h3 class="uppercase text-[1.17rem] md:text-xl xl:text-2xl font-medium">Solution: microwave them</h3>
                <img src="../assets/images/recipe2.jpg" class="w-[75%] mt-4 lg:mt-7" alt="">

It’s just enough time to release the juices, but be careful not to go overboard and dry the flesh out.Try one of our zesty lemon recipes.</p>

                <h3 class="uppercase text-[1.17rem] md:text-xl xl:text-2xl font-medium">Solution: make instant flatbread</h3>
                <img src="../assets/images/recipe2.jpg" class="w-[75%] mt-4 lg:mt-7" alt="">
                <p class="text-black text-[1.05rem] sm:text-[1.16rem] md:text-[1.22rem] lg:text-[1.28rem] my-4 lg:my-7">If you have plain flour in the cupboard, you always have bread on hand. Just take one mug of plain flour combined with 1-2 teaspoons of olive oil per person, then slowly add cold water until it’s a soft, smooth dough which leaves the bowl clean. Divide the dough into balls, roll out to a 2mm thickness then dry fry in a non-stick pan. They’ll only take a few moments and are ready when both sides have golden brown patches all over.</p>

                <h3 class="uppercase text-[1.17rem] md:text-xl xl:text-2xl font-medium">Solution: reach for the wine</h3>
                <img src="../assets/images/recipe2.jpg" class="w-[75%] mt-4 lg:mt-7" alt="">
                <p class="text-black text-[1.05rem] sm:text-[1.16rem] md:text-[1.22rem] lg:text-[1.28rem] my-4 lg:my-7">If you need your meat injected with a short, sharp burst of flavour, choose marinade ingredients wisely. Red wine quickly penetrates meat, giving it a deep colour, while citrus zest and juice tenderises it rapidly.</p>

                <h3 class="uppercase text-[1.17rem] md:text-xl xl:text-2xl font-medium">Scenario #8: I want to make an easy rainbow cake</h3>
                <h3 class="uppercase text-[1.17rem] md:text-xl xl:text-2xl font-medium">Solution: ditch the liquid food colouring</h3>
                <img src="../assets/images/recipe2.jpg" class="w-[75%] mt-4 lg:mt-7" alt="">
                <p class="text-black text-[1.05rem] sm:text-[1.16rem] md:text-[1.22rem] lg:text-[1.28rem] my-4 lg:my-7">We love a stripy rainbow cake, but it’s perhaps one for an experienced baker to take on. If you want your sponge to sing with Technicolor joy but need an easier route to success, pick up a tub of multi-coloured hundreds and thousands. Mix some through your sponge batter (not too many) and when you cut a slice of your finished cake, you'll have beautiful polka dots.</p>

                <h3 class="uppercase text-[1.17rem] md:text-xl xl:text-2xl font-medium">Scenario #9: I can't peel a kiwi properly</h3>
                <h3 class="uppercase text-[1.17rem] md:text-xl xl:text-2xl font-medium">Solution: scoop out the flesh</h3>
                <img src="../assets/images/recipe2.jpg" class="w-[75%] mt-4 lg:mt-7" alt="">
                <p class="text-black text-[1.05rem] sm:text-[1.16rem] md:text-[1.22rem] lg:text-[1.28rem] my-4 lg:my-7">To peel a kiwi, just chop off the top and bottom, then push a dessertspoon in between the fruit and the skin. Turn the kiwi until all the skin falls off the back of the spoon.</p>

                <h3 class="uppercase text-[1.17rem] md:text-xl xl:text-2xl font-medium">Scenario #10: I don’t want my avocado to go brown</h3>
                <h3 class="uppercase text-[1.17rem] md:text-xl xl:text-2xl font-medium">Solution: twist it</h3> 
                <img src="../assets/images/recipe2.jpg" class="w-[75%] mt-4 lg:mt-7" alt="">
                <p class="text-black text-[1.05rem] sm:text-[1.16rem] md:text-[1.22rem] lg:text-[1.28rem] my-4 lg:my-7">When you cut the avocado in half, twist into two pieces, then use a spoon to scoop out the flesh from the side without the stone for immediate use. Return the empty skin to the other half, which still contains the stone, using the skin to cover it over. Keeping the stone in and covering with the skin helps retain colour and freshness until the following day.</p>

                <h3 class="uppercase text-[1.17rem] md:text-xl xl:text-2xl font-medium">Scenario #11: I want perfect fried eggs</h3>
                <h3 class="uppercase text-[1.17rem] md:text-xl xl:text-2xl font-medium">Solution: steam them</h3>
                <img src="../assets/images/recipe2.jpg" class="w-[75%] mt-4 lg:mt-7" alt="">
                <p class="text-black text-[1.05rem] sm:text-[1.16rem] md:text-[1.22rem] lg:text-[1.28rem] my-4 lg:my-7">Achieve the perfect set white and runny yolk with a few splashes of water. Fry the eggs in a non-stick pan and when the whites are almost cooked, put a few drops of water into the pan, quickly cover it with a lid and turn the heat down low, or off completely, and leave for a minute or two to finish cooking. The effect will be a perfect semi-poach.</p>

                <h3 class="uppercase text-[1.17rem] md:text-xl xl:text-2xl font-medium">Scenario #25: I only need a tiny squeeze of citrus, not the whole fruit</h3>
                <h3 class="uppercase text-[1.17rem] md:text-xl xl:text-2xl font-medium">Solution: spike it</h3>
                <img src="../assets/images/recipe2.jpg" class="w-[75%] mt-4 lg:mt-7" alt="">
                <p class="text-black text-[1.05rem] sm:text-[1.16rem] md:text-[1.22rem] lg:text-[1.28rem] my-4 lg:my-7">Don’t cut a whole orange, lime or lemon and risk the rest going to waste for the sake of one small squeeze of juice. Use a skewer to pierce it to release a few drops without having to break the fruit open.</p>
