        <p class="text-black text-[0.95rem] sm:text-[1.05rem] md:text-[1.12rem] lg:text-[1.18rem]">Damn Delicious® was simply a hobby, but now it’s my full-time job. Coming from a very traditional Korean household, I was destined to be one of three things: a lawyer, a dentist or a doctor. So as a grad school hobby, I created a Tumblr account in April 2011 to document some of my favorite recipes. I had one reader, making less than $0.30 per month.</p>

        <p class="text-black text-[0.95rem] sm:text-[1.05rem] md:text-[1.12rem] lg:text-[1.18rem]">But 14 years later, Damn Delicious® has grown into something that I never thought possible. I have connected with readers all over the world, conquered so many culinary feats in my kitchen, and collaborated with brands that I always dreamed to work with.</p>

        <p class="text-black text-[0.95rem] sm:text-[1.05rem] md:text-[1.12rem] lg:text-[1.18rem]">Damn Delicious has even grown into an amazing team of individuals working together to create the best possible recipes. We create recipes, step-by-step tutorials, and videos that focus on quick and easy meals for the everyday home cook to show you that it really doesn’t take much to make a homemade meal completely from scratch.</p>
