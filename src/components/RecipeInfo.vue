        <p class="text-base lg:text-lg">This is one of those lightening fast speedy weeknight-worthy dinners. With just a handful of ingredients and minimal prep time, this comes together in 45 min, start to finish (and for most of the time, we’re just letting it simmer).</p>

        <p class="text-base lg:text-lg">So what exactly is gyudon? Gyudon is a traditional Japanese beef bowl, a popular fast food item thanks to Yoshinoya, with thinly sliced beef and sweet onion in a quick-simmered sweet and savory soy-based sauce.</p>

        <p class="text-base lg:text-lg">The key is using paper thin cut beef here, readily available in most Asian grocery stores. And they’ll have kombu and bonito flakes as well for your dashi broth (more on that below). Or you can place the ribeye in the freezer until firm, slicing as thin as possible. This thin cut of beef makes this dish super fast comfort food.</p>
