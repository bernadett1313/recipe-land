                <h4 class="font-bold">Why use dashi broth?</h4>
                <p>The dashi broth can be made easily from scratch using water, kombu (seaweed) and bonito flakes in a very quick 10 minute simmer, forming the base of this dish. It infuses the thinly sliced beef with all the flavor, keeping it tender and moist.</p>

                <h4 class="font-bold">What do you serve this with?</h4>
                <p>Gyudon is traditionally served with a raw egg yolk (or fried egg, if desired), pickled ginger, green onions and sesame seeds. Or sometimes we just serve over microwave rice when there isnâ€™t enough time!</p>
